A Tachyon Digital project

11.26.2013

A Learning Lab environment for programming via the creation of a game involving using tools to break into
encrypted networks.

Game will be engineered to use and develop the following skill sets of players within the game.
 1.) Problem Solving
  -Project will involve the players choices in the game in a non-linear way.
 2.) Technical Thinking
  -Project will often provided "debugging" information to the player in a way that forces the player to observe and
  draw conclusions from incomplete data.
 3.) Decision Making
  -Project will sometimes involve choices made during timed situations where rapid decision making using provided
  information will be critical to success.
4.) Ideas for Network types
  -Make it so certain networks have certain password types. Simpler networks may only have alpha-numeric passwords while
  more heavily encrypted networks need specific characters and lengths.
  -Some networks may use public/private keys to access instead, requiring the player to develop a method of retrieving
  a public key to gain access to the network.
