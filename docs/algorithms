Problem: How do we simulate a networking environment in a simple manner?

Algorithm 1: Create "nodes" as objects/classes that have attributes such as "Addresses" (Possibly use hex-based addressing to differentiate this from reality?) with each node being an individual "place" in the internetwork. Each node could be a server or router depending on attributes.
  ex1:
    router = node.create
      router.addr = hexadecimal address (30 bit addressing) 000.000.000 through 200.200.200. This gives a total of 512^3                      total addresses, or 134,217,728 total addresses, more than the total number of nodes we would realistic-                     ally be able to generate in the game.
      router.type = determines whether the node is a transfer node or end node (transfer or end).
      router.neighbor[] = List of neighbors by address. Helps for forwarding.
    server = node.create
      server.addr = hexadecimal address (30 bit addressing) 000.000.000 through 200.200.200. This gives a total of 512^3                      total addresses, or 134,217,728 total addresses, more than the total number of nodes we would realistic-                     ally be able to generate in the game.
      server.type = determines whether the node is a transfer node or end node (transfer or end).
      server.neighbor[] = List of neighbors by address. For servers this will be their GW router.

Problem: How do we simulate a "secured" server beyond simple password security? How can we build "tools" for access?

Algorithm 1: Create "Password Cracking" mini-game similar to hacking in Fallout 3+.

Algorithm 2: Create "Moving Cipher" encryption mini-game, where players are forced to solve a math problem within a
  specific time-frame to move on.

Problem: How do we create a multi-player environment for the game?

Algorithm 1: Create a server/client system where a chat-style messaging system can be used between players. Have each
  "node" be effected by any player currently online and relay those changes to all players actively. This could allow
  for some cooperative as well as competitive play, where players either work together or race each other.
